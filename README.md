## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* **C++**: The core programming language.
* **Standard Libraries**:
    * `<iostream>` for handling console input and output.
    * `<iomanip>` for formatting currency values.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler installed on your machine. The most common is **g++**, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

* **Windows**: Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) or use the C++ workload in Visual Studio.
* **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install` in your terminal.
* **Linux**: Install the `build-essential` package.
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    ```

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository (replace with your actual repo URL):**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name](https://github.com/sharma-bhupesh/Banking-ATM-Software.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Compile the code (assuming the file is named `bank.cpp`):**
    ```sh
    g++ bank.cpp -o atm
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    ./atm
    ```
    (On Windows, you may need to run `atm.exe`)

## üìñ Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be prompted to enter your PIN.
* The default PIN is hardcoded as `1327`.
* Enter `0000` to exit the program at the PIN prompt.

Once authenticated, use the on-screen menu by entering the number corresponding to your desired action.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

This is a simple project, but future enhancements could include:

- [ ] **Multiple User Accounts**: Allow switching between different users.
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Save account balances to a file so data isn't lost on exit.
- [ ] **Object-Oriented Design**: Refactor the code into `Account` and `ATM` classes.
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**: Gracefully handle non-numeric inputs.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
